# Unity Scripts Pack
![Made for Unity](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20For-Unity-black.svg?style=for-the-badge)

A Pack of a bunch of handy scripts for Unity *(may be a bit unorganised)*

## Contains
 - Bitmap Text Rendering
 - Audio Managers
 - Game Statistics
 - Very Simple Input Controller
 - IO Controller *(in dev)*
 - Open Project in Code Option
 - Utility Pack
 - Cheat System *(in dev)*
 - Min Max

 ## Install Instuctions
 There are 2 ways (currently):
  1. Clone directly to your project *(don't do this)*
  2. Add the repo as a [submodule](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) in your repo *(the smarter way but requires that your project is setup as a repo)*
  3. (Upcoming) Add the repo as a package though the UPM
